# Code

- Code should be easy to read and understand. Not with comments, but with the coding logic itself.
  - Create modular code for easy readability and maintainability, but do not overabstract. If we're just doing something once or twice, just do things the direct way.
- Examples should be easy to copy and paste.
  - Dummy variables: Do not _ever_ use fake placeholders like /path/to/your/file or foo.txt. Create a variable with a name and reference that variable in the script or code, so I can then
- style: use tabs, not spaces
- Do not add comments or write extra documentation unless I tell you to.

# Explanations
Only explain things or create summaries when I ask you to. Don't write extra documentation unless I tell you to.
